These two patches are the original incremental mode work against JtR.

Clortho - modifies JtR Incremental to generate work units and not actually
crypt the keys.  Unfortunately generating the work takes minutes per unit,
and it's single-threaded.  Making this range generation code faster would
greatly help improve the project.  This was the original 'Clortho'

Zuul - modifications to JtR which allow the --stop option, which will
look for additional data in the .rec file to determine when to stop cracking.

The patches were tested (hand-crafting the .rec files) against the 
Incremental:All4 and correctness was verified.  However due to the 2+
minutes per unit generation time of Clortho.patch, this was not feasable for
the larger lengths, as a very small number of workers could starve out
the generator.
